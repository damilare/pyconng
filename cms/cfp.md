We have now closed the CFP for talks. However we'd still welcome proposals for workshops, clinics, sprints, and other activities.

This is a community conference. You’re coming to the event, and that makes you part of the community and makes this your conference. If you’ve done something that you think other people might be interested in, or that you think they should know about, we would love to know about it.

<a href="#" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Submit a proposal</a>


We don’t just want to hear from the experts or famous names - other perspectives are just as valuable, so don’t let the idea that you’re not expert or famous enough stop you because this won’t stop us from selecting your talk or the audience from enjoying it.

Note that there is a programme of [financial support for speakers](http://www).

## We *especially* want proposals from...

   People who are minorities in this field

   [Diversity at PyCon UK](http://www.) is important to us. We want the conference to represent our community better and in turn to help make the community more inclusive.

   Please do come forward with a [proposal](http://www). We can't succeed in this without your participation.

*First-time speakers*

   If you haven’t spoken at a conference before, this is your invitation to do so. After all, we want to be remembered as the conference where you started your superstar speaking career. You’ll find that a Python audience is friendly and receptive, so don’t be shy.

   **If you’d like any help in proposing, preparing or presenting your talk, whoever you are and whatever kind of help you’d find useful: please see our speaker mentor programme.**

### Talk

Do you have something to share with the rest of the community?

Proposals on any subject are welcomed, at any level of technical expertise. We've got slots for talks of 20 or 45 minutes (including questions).

[Tell us](http://) about your experiments, discoveries, solutions, achievements and other adventures, using the talk proposal form.

### Lightning talks
There’ll also be opportunities for five-minute lightning talks. You don’t need to register in advance; just put your name down on the day.

### Workshop
Can you lead a tutorial, on any Python or related topic?

We’ll be holding workshops aimed at different levels of technical expertise.

Please don’t hesitate to [suggest a workshop for the event](http://), using the workshop proposal form. We’re open to all kinds of ideas, and especially ones we haven’t even thought of.

### Code clinic
Could you be a friendly neighbourhood code doctor?

Alongside the sprints, we’re holding code clinics, where an expert will be on hand to help with people’s Python questions and problems.

A clinic might run for an hour or two. If you like to [run a clinic](http://) on a particular subject, or even a general one, please use the workshop proposal form.

### Lunchtime event
Lunchtime gatherings for a discussion or demonstration - [propose one](http://)!

### Poster
Describe your work/thoughts/plans on a large poster, and discuss it with visitors. [What do you have to share](http://)?


## How to submit a proposal

<a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Submit a proposal</a>

There’s a proposal form for talks and a proposal form for tutorials and demonstrations. Take a look at them - they’ll make it clearer how this works.

Don’t agonise over your proposal. Just get it in. We’ll get back to you if anything’s not clear.

Don’t hesitate to submit more than one proposal.

The deadline for submissions is the end of Tuesday 28th June (BST).

## Need help?

Perhaps you’re not sure what aspect of your proposed subject will be most appropriate or interesting, or how to word it, or what level to pitch it at. Perhaps you’re not sure it’s what we’re looking for.

That’s OK. In fact, we have a [speaker mentor programme]() in place to help you.

If there’s anything we can do that would make it easier for you to submit a proposal, just get in touch. We want to help.

## How we'll choose

We’re going to choose a selection of talks, tutorials and demonstrations that we feel add up to the most enjoyable and interesting programme for our attendees.

We won’t just be choosing the ones from the most expert speakers, or even the most exciting subjects, because we need to have a good balance as well.

We’ll publish the list of selected talks as soon as we can after the deadline.

## Financial support for speakers

Grants to assist speakers on low budgets will be available, as well as free and discounted tickets. They'll be allocated by the committee. Any speaker who needs help will receive it. Financial assistance applications close when the CFP closes.

<a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Apply for financial assistance</a>

The grants committee will be especially interested in receiving applications from people belonging to under-represented demographic groups.
