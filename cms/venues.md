### Getting to Cardiff
#### Trains
Trains to Cardiff arrive right in the city centre, at Cardiff Central railway station. Unfortunately, engineering work at the Severn Tunnel means that trains around the time of the conference will be disrupted, and some parts of affected journeys may be replaced by bus services.

[Please plan your travel accordingly]().

Rail travel in the UK can be very expensive, especially if you don’t buy your tickets until you travel. For much cheaper fares:

buy your tickets about twelve weeks in advance, when the cheapest Advance Single tickets are released
note that travel at off-peak times will be cheaper
... and that buying two singles can sometimes be cheaper than buying a return ticket
#### Buses
Cardiff Central Bus Station is closed until 2017, but most if not all services will stop near the city centre, on Castle Street so you shouldn't be inconvenienced (in fact, the Castle Street stop is closer to the venue). Just be aware of where your bus will be arriving and leaving from!

[National Express]() has some good services to Cardiff, but check for services provided by other lines.

#### Planes
Cardiff's pocket-sized airport has daily flights from several European cities. It's extremely convenient if you can find a flight that lands there. A bus into town (~35 minutes) from the airport is about £5; a taxi (~20 minutes) will be about £25.

Bristol Airport is a larger and served by more flights. A [National Express]() bus will take you to the centre of Cardiff in about 1 hour 40 minutes, for about £20.

Birmingham Airport is about two hours away by train. The trip requires a change at Birmingham New Street station.

Flights from London Heathrow have reasonable connections by bus. Other London airports are further away. Avoid flying to London Stansted or Luton airports unless you have to. Getting from there to Cardiff will be an unrewarding experience.

#### Cars
There's limited parking in the city centre, and you'll pay for the privilege. However, if you need to use a car because of mobility issues, please contact us.
